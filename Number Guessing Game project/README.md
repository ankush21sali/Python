I just built a simple Number Guessing Game using Python! 🐍
It randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has 10 attempts to guess it. The game gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low, and it handles invalid input gracefully.

🧠 Features:

Random number generation 🎲

Input validation 🛡️

Attempt tracking 🧮

User feedback on guesses 💬
